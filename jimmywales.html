            <p class="lead">Jimmy Donal "Jimbo" Wales (born August 7, 1966) is an American Internet entrepreneur, best known as a co-founder of Wikipedia and Wikia. Wales was born in Huntsville, Alabama, United States. There, he went to Randolph School. He then earned bachelor’s and master’s degrees in finance. In 1996, he and two partners founded Bomis. Bomis was an Internet portal with entertainment and adult content. The company gave money for Nupedia (2000–2003) and, after that, Wikipedia.</p>

          <div class="col-lg-4 mr-auto">
            <p class="lead">On January 15, 2001, with Larry Sanger and others, Wales launched Wikipedia. Wikipedia was and still is a free, open content encyclopedia. It grew and became popular very quickly. As Wikipedia became known to the public, he became the project’s promoter and spokesperson. He is often called a co-founder of Wikipedia, though he has argued the "co-" part. He said he was the only founder. Wales is on the Board of Trustees of the Wikimedia Foundation. In 2004, he co-founded Wikia, a wiki-hosting service which tries to make money. In 2015, Wales started the Jimmy Wales Foundation for freedom of expression, to try to help bloggers or internet activists who are in prison.</p>

              <hr class="star-dark mb-5">
              <img class="img-fluid mb-5" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a3/Bomis-staff-summer-2000.jpg/800px-Bomis-staff-summer-2000.jpg" alt="">
              <p class="mb-5">In 1994, Wales took a job with Chicago Options Associates, a futures and options trading firm in Chicago, Illinois.[19][25][26] Wales has described himself as having been addicted to the Internet from an early stage and he wrote computer code during his leisure time. During his studies in Alabama, he had become an obsessive player of Multi-User Dungeons (MUDs)—a type of virtual role-playing game—and thereby experienced the potential of computer networks to foster large-scale collaborative projects.[24][27]

Inspired by the remarkably successful initial public offering of Netscape in 1995, and having accumulated capital through "speculating on interest-rate and foreign-currency fluctuations",[16] Wales decided to leave the realm of financial trading and became an Internet entrepreneur.[24] In 1996, he and two partners founded Bomis,[16][28] a web portal featuring user-generated webrings and, for a time, erotic photographs.[29] Wales described it as a "guy-oriented search engine" with a market similar to that of Maxim magazine;[17][19][30] the Bomis venture did not ultimately turn out to be successful.</p>

              <p class="mb-5">In mid-2003, Wales set up the Wikimedia Foundation (WMF), a non-profit organization founded in St. Petersburg, Florida and later headquartered in San Francisco, California. All intellectual property rights and domain names pertaining to Wikipedia were moved to the new foundation, whose purpose is to establish general policy for the encyclopedia and its sister projects. Wales has been a member of the Wikimedia Foundation's Board of Trustees since it was formed and was its official chairman from 2003 through 2006. Since 2006 he has been accorded the honorary title of chairman emeritus and holds the board-appointed "community founder's seat" that was installed in 2008. His work for the foundation, including his appearances to promote it at computer and educational conferences, has always been unpaid. Wales has often joked that donating Wikipedia to the foundation was both the "dumbest and the smartest" thing he had done. On one hand, he estimated that Wikipedia was worth US$3 billion; on the other, he weighed his belief that the donation made its success possible.

Wales gives an annual "State of the Wiki" address at the Wikimania conference.</p>

              <p class="mb-5">Originally, Bomis planned to make Wikipedia a profitable business.[39] Sanger initially saw Wikipedia primarily as a tool to aid Nupedia development. Wales feared that, at worst, it might produce "complete rubbish".[26] To the surprise of Sanger and Wales, within a few days of launching, the number of articles on Wikipedia had outgrown that of Nupedia, and a small collective of editors had formed.[25][27] It was Jimmy Wales, along with other people, who came up with the broader idea of an open-source, collaborative encyclopedia that would accept contributions from ordinary people.[40] Initially, neither Sanger nor Wales knew what to expect from the Wikipedia initiative.[26][27] Many of the early contributors to the site were familiar with the model of the free culture movement, and, like Wales, many of them sympathized with the open-source movement.</p>
